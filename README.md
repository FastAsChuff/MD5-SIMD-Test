# MD5-SIMD-Test
This program demonstrates SSE2 or AVX2 SIMD vector maths capability. It can but compiled with just a single line change for either SSE2 or AVX2. The SSE2 version will run on any CPU that supports SSE2 vector extensions, but will not run on earlier CPUs. Similarly, the AVX2 version will only run on CPUs that support AVX2. The user enters a short string, and the program calculates approximately 34 billion md5 hashes, 8 at a time in parallel, to find input strings which produce md5 hashes beginning with 8 hex zeroes. It runs on a single thread which can be verified using system monitoring tools. It's purpose is just to demonstrate the computational performance that SIMD vectorisation can have over scalar processes. Also, it is meant to allow performance comparisons to be made between AVX2 and SSE2. The program is optimised for AVX2 which is why 8 md5 hashes are computed at once. The final 8 characters of the input string are the first 16 uppercase characters of the English alphabet, making 2^32 variations for each of the 8 SIMD 'lanes'.
